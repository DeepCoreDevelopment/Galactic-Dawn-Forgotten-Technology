# New Dawn - Forgotten Technology

This mod allows you to build the high tech buildings which you can find on worlds owned by Fallen Empires.
In the vanilla game the technology to make these buildings is 'long forgotten' but if the Fallen Empires were once mighty enough to figure this stuff out, why can't you?
In addition to being able to build these extra powerfull buildings, you are now also able to construct tier 5 mines, power plants and farms on non-capital worlds. 

## Features
- Three previously unconstructable buildings
- Three new technologies, one for each building
- Tier 5 buildings can be constructed on any planet.

### Technolgies
Dark Matter Extraction

- Unlocks Dark Matter Power Plant

> Given more time to research dark matter, our physicists believe we can extract small amounts of dark matter from cosmic radiation and turn it into energy.

Mineral Fabrication

- Unlocks Autonomous Fabricators

> Using large amounts of energy, we believe it's possible to create minerals. this process is much more efficient than having to dig deep underground.

Nutrient Manufacturing

- Unlocks Agri-Processing Complex

> Turning energy into food, scientist have been trying to see if it's possible for years. A recent breakthrough has shown us that we're closer than we thought...
